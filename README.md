### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate at Stanford University pursuing a B.S. Physics (Quantum Information) and an M.S. in Computer Science (ML / AI).

My projects, listed from highest to least priority:
1. a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn market-making in a high-frequencytrading environment! (check out [MARKET-MAKING-RL](https://github.com/picklenchips/MARKET-MAKING-RL))
2. a graph neural network to track particles in CERN's ALICE experiment [halfcaf/ALICE-EATS-AN-APPLE](https://github.com/halfcaf12/ALICE-EATS-AN-APPLE/tree/main)
    - where I also made a ROOT file processor in C to translate from CERN's data while their VM was under repair
3. HTML/Katex to Latex converter, for exporting Notion files to .tex files

Other interests:
- **Sports**: Rock climbing, Skiing, Soccer, XC Running
- **Video Games**: Minecraft, Hades, 3 Billion Humans

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate at Stanford University pursuing a B.S. Physics (Quantum Information) and an M.S. in Applied Physics (Quantum Engineering).

### Projects
1. Building a web application that runs quantum algorithm optimization on various electrical grid problems, at [QUANTUM-GRID-CLIMATE](https://github.com/picklenchips/QUANTUM-GRID-CLIMATE)
1. A reinforcement learning algorithm to learn market-making in a high-frequency trading environment! (check out [MARKET-MAKING-RL](https://github.com/picklenchips/MARKET-MAKING-RL))
1. A graph neural network to track particles in CERN's ALICE experiment [halfcaf/ALICE-EATS-AN-APPLE](https://github.com/halfcaf12/ALICE-EATS-AN-APPLE/tree/main)
    - where I also made a [ROOT-to-CSV](https://github.com/halfcaf12/ALICE-EATS-AN-APPLE/blob/main/data/treeToCSV.C) converter in C to translate from CERN's data while their VM was under repair

Other interests:
- **Sports**: Rock climbing, Skiing, Soccer, XC Running
- **Video Games**: Minecraft, Hades, 3 Billion Humans
